# Google Earth Engine Cloud-Masked Composites

## **Introduction** 

These scripts perform basic cloud and custom cloud/shadow masking for images taken by Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites. It is usable in the Google Earth Engine Code Editor, using available surface reflectance imagery from the Earth Engine Data Catalog. Each script works with a set AOI to filter imagery collection and generate annual cloud-masked composites based on a selected time range (pre-set to 4-months of the Austral summer). Each final annual cloud-masked image is comprised of multiple mosaicked cloud masked images, in order of mask performance. FInal analysis-ready images are set to be exported to Google Drive.

Scripts are split by the satellite imagery that is processed. Note that Landsat scripts are grouped for compatable imagery.
 - Landsat 1, 2, and 3
 - Landsat 4, 5, and 7
 - Landsat 8 and 9
 - Sentinel-2

## **Code logistics**

### <ins> Setup </ins>	
  -	Import AOI shapefile from assets	
  -	Apply optical and thermal scaling factors for surface reflectance imagery
         -	Scaling factors can be found on the Earth Engine Data Catalog  	  
  -	Set visualisation parameters for the final (and test) composite imagery

### <ins> Masking </ins>	
### Landsat
    - Basic QA Pixel Cloud Masking with optional buffer
        -	Bits are used in the L457 and L89 scripts to remove pixels idenfied as clouds, cirrus, or shaddow
    -	Custom Cloud Score Mask with optional buffer
        -	Identify cloudy pixels for masking based on brightness in the blue band, all visible bands, and infrared bands
        -	Detect dark pixels and identify possible shadow areas based on solar azimuth angle 
    - *Note: At this time, the L123 Script only has basic QA Pixel Cloud Masking
### Sentinel 2
  - Basic QA60 Cloud Mask with optional buffer
        -	Bit 10: Clouds
        -	Bit 11: Cirrus
  -	Custom Cloud Score Mask with optional buffer
        -	Identify cloudy pixels for masking based on brightness in the blue band, all visible bands, and infrared bands
        -	Detect dark pixels and identify possible shadow areas based on solar azimuth angle 
  -	Custom Cloud Probability Mask

### <ins> Buffer Cloud Probability Mask (_For Sentinel 2 only_) </ins>	
  -	Since the additional CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE filter, is not usable metadata in GEE's S2 Cloud Probability band, the two collections, S2_Harmonized and S2_CloudProb, must be manually aligned.
  -	This 'matching' is done by filtering through the times that the S2_Harmonized images are taken to match them each with the time that the corresponding derived 'Cloud Probability' image was produced.
  -	There is a small difference in time between when these two events (when the S2_Harmonized and the S2_CloudProb images are produced) occur.
  -	Hence, the getCloudProbImage function below adds a buffer of an hour before and after the harmonized images were produced to match to then filter the could probability images.
  -	Function will be mapped to S2_Harmonized collection to create corresponding S2_CloudProb collection. 
  -	Create a cloud probability mask (where cloud probability is less than 20%).
  -	Apply the cloud probability mask to the Sentinel-2 image.

### <ins> Image collection & compositing </ins>	
  -	Build a cloud-filtered, scaled image collection for a chosen time period. 
  -	Compute composites for each year with various levels of masking. 
  -	Add layers to the map for each year for visualization (optional â€“ used to check cloud masking performance).

### <ins> Image mosaicking </ins>	
  -	Create a mosaic by stacking the composites in an image collection and apply the mosaic operation. 

### <ins> Image export </ins>	
  -	Specify the region to export and increase max pixel count if needed.
